"""Proactive, cross-run rate limiting for Arctic Shift requests.

A single shared limiter paces all outbound requests so the tool can never
burst past the mirror's tolerance and get us blocked. The limiter is a token bucket
with a capacity of one: requests are spaced evenly at 60 / max_per_minute
seconds apart, never bursted. This is deliberately conservative — the goal is
to under-request, not to squeeze the rate ceiling.

The risk here is repeated *runs*, not one burst, so
the limiter persists recent request timestamps to a local state file and loads
them on startup. A second run within the rolling window therefore waits for the
budget the previous run consumed. Wall-clock time is used (not monotonic) so the
state is meaningful across separate processes; the rolling window need only be
approximately right, and it errs toward under-requesting.

The state file holds nothing but request timestamps — no secrets — per the
workspace credential-safety rules.
